# 100DaysOfCode
So I was reading that blogpost about someone taking a challange of coding for 100 days straight. 
I thought to myself: CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!

The rules are simple:
  - Code everyday for 1 hour (at least) and do it for 100 days.
  - Tweet your progress with [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode) hashtag.

## My goal for this challenge is creating a VR game
The game creating engine I'm using is [AppGameKit](https://www.appgamekit.com/)
It's a neat small beast that I believe should get more public recognition :)
It has a free version, that is almost feature-full like the paid one, but adds a watermark
